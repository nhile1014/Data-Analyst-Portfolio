# Nhi Le - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I am Nhi. I just graduated a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Business Analytics in December 2021, majoring in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at University of North Texas. I had worked as Senior Marketing Executive for two real estate companies in more than 3 years before I moved to the US for my education about 5 years ago.

With more than two years of studying and practicing, I get skilled in a wide variety of software and data management systems, ranging from Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau to big data supporting like Hadoop, Spark. Besides, during the time I had worked as Marketing Executive, I had sales and marketing insight that helps me to contribute on not only technical skills but also business side. 

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
