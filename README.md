# Nhi Le - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, my name is Nhi Le. I hold a Master of Science in Business Analytics with a concentration in Data Engineering from the University of North Texas and an MBA from the University of Texas at Tyler.

With experience as a Data Analyst and Project Manager, I specialize in designing and implementing scalable data solutions, leading teams in data migration projects, and optimizing database structures. I have expertise in SQL, Python, Snowflake, and cloud platforms such as AWS. My background includes building interactive dashboards with Power BI, Sigma Computing, and Figma to support data-driven decision-making.

Beyond technical skills, I have experience in project management, coordinating cross-functional teams, and streamlining business processes to drive efficiency. My previous work in marketing further strengthens my ability to bridge the gap between business strategy and data analytics.

This repository showcases my projects, technical expertise, and continuous learning in data engineering, analytics, and software development.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics and data science projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### A. Data Science

#### 1. A sentiment-based model using hotel reviews and Machine Learning techniques
**Code:** [Link](https://github.com/nhile1014/project_code/blob/main/HotelReviewsSentimentAnalysis.ipynb)  
**Desctiption:** The data was collected from Booking.com. The dataset originally held a little over 20,000 reviews, hotel scores, and all geographical locations across Europe. The project includes the following steps: Sentiment Annotation, Data Exploration, Data Visualization, Text Cleaning and Text preprocess, Training Model, Testing Saved model.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, sklearn, tensorflow, keras.   
**Results:** The sentiment results will be used to determine the number of positive and negative reviews.

### B. Data Engineering

#### 2. Basic Sentiment Analysis using Hive
**Code**: [Link](https://github.com/nhile1014/Basic-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Hive/blob/main/README.md)  
**Desctiption:** To determine each tweet's score and identify whether the tweet had a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, I created an excel file calls tweet.csv with 20 tweets. Use the Dictionary.txt file for determining the score.  
**Skills:** sentiment analysis using Hive.   
**Technology:** Hive, Hadoop  
**Result:** Determine the score for each tweet. Identify whether the tweet had a positive or negative sentiment  

#### 3. Basic data analysis using Spark
**Code**: [Link](https://github.com/nhile1014/basic-data-analysis-using-Spark/blob/main/README.md)  
**Desctiption:** Explore the Craft Brewery data to perform basic data analysis using Spark.  
**Skills:** Data analytics.  
**Technology:** Spark.  
**Result:** Determine the number of breweries in each state, the cities with the most breweries, and the most brewed beer style  

### C. Data Visualization

#### 4. Sales Performance of a company from 2003-2005
**Tableau Public:** [Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nhi.thanh.yen.le/viz/finalproject_Nhi_Le/DASHBORAD)  
**Desctiption:** The dataset is about a company that sells sevens products all over the world, has more than $10 million in sales revenue for almost three years. This dataset contains 25 variables and 2823 rows of data. This project aims to create a dashboard that reports and analyzes the sales performance from 2003 to 2005. Then, I have created some linear trend models and sale forecasting for the next 12 months to better understand the dataset and the sales performance.  
**Skills:** Designing an anylycial dashboard.  
**Technology:** Tableau (Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public)
