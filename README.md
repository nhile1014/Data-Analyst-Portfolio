# About
Hi, I am Nhi. I just graduated a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Business Analytics, majoring in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at University of North Texas in December 2021. I had worked as Senior Marketing Executive for two real estate companies in more than 3 years before I moved to the US for my education about 5 years ago.
